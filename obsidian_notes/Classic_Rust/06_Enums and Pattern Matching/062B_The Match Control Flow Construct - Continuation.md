```rust
    fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            None => None,
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }

    let five = Some(5);
    let six = plus_one(five);
    let none = plus_one(None);
```

[Listing 6-5](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch06-02-match.html#listing-6-5): A function that uses a `match` expression on an `Option<i32>`

Let’s examine the first execution of `plus_one` in more detail. When we call
`plus_one(five)`, the variable `x` in the body of `plus_one` will have the
value `Some(5)`. We then compare that against each match arm:

```rust
            None => None,
```

The `Some(5)` value doesn’t match the pattern `None`, so we continue to the
next arm:

```rust
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
```

Does `Some(5)` match `Some(i)`? It does! We have the same variant. The `i`
binds to the value contained in `Some`, so `i` takes the value `5`. The code in
the match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of `i` and create a
new `Some` value with our total `6` inside.

Now let’s consider the second call of `plus_one` in Listing 6-5, where `x` is
`None`. We enter the `match` and compare to the first arm:

```rust
            None => None,
```

It matches! There’s no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the
`None` value on the right side of `=>`. Because the first arm matched, no other
arms are compared.

Combining `match` and enums is useful in many situations. You’ll see this
pattern a lot in Rust code: `match` against an enum, bind a variable to the
data inside, and then execute code based on it. It’s a bit tricky at first, but
once you get used to it, you’ll wish you had it in all languages. It’s
consistently a user favorite.

## Matches Are Exhaustive

There’s one other aspect of `match` we need to discuss: The arms’ patterns must
cover all possibilities. Consider this version of our `plus_one` function,
which has a bug and won’t compile:

```rust
    fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
        match x {
            Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        }
    }
```

We didn’t handle the `None` case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s
a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this
error:

```console
$ cargo run

Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which
pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are _exhaustive_: We must exhaust every last
possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of
`Option<T>`, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the
`None` case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might
have null, thus making the billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier impossible.

## Catch-All Patterns and the `_` Placeholder

Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but
for all other values take one default action. Imagine we’re implementing a game
where, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn’t move but instead
gets a fancy new hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat. For all
other values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game board. Here’s
a `match` that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll
hardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by
functions without bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for
this example:

```rust
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        other => move_player(other),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
```

For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values `3` and `7`. For
the last arm that covers every other possible value, the pattern is the
variable we’ve chosen to name `other`. The code that runs for the `other` arm
uses the variable by passing it to the `move_player` function.

This code compiles, even though we haven’t listed all the possible values a
`u8` can have, because the last pattern will match all values not specifically
listed. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that `match` must be
exhaustive. Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the
patterns are evaluated in order. If we had put the catch-all arm earlier, the
other arms would never run, so Rust will warn us if we add arms after a
catch-all!

Rust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but don’t want to
_use_ the value in the catch-all pattern: `_` is a special pattern that matches
any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren’t going to
use the value, so Rust won’t warn us about an unused variable.

Let’s change the rules of the game: Now, if you roll anything other than a 3 or
a 7, you must roll again. We no longer need to use the catch-all value, so we
can change our code to use `_` instead of the variable named `other`:

```rust
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ => reroll(),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn reroll() {}
```

This example also meets the exhaustiveness requirement because we’re explicitly
ignoring all other values in the last arm; we haven’t forgotten anything.

Finally, we’ll change the rules of the game one more time so that nothing else
happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7. We can express
that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type we mentioned in [“The Tuple
Type”][tuples] section) as the code that goes with the `_` arm:

```rust
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ => (),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
```

Here, we’re telling Rust explicitly that we aren’t going to use any other value
that doesn’t match a pattern in an earlier arm, and we don’t want to run any
code in this case.

There’s more about patterns and matching that we’ll cover in [Chapter
19][ch19-00-patterns]. For now, we’re going to move on to the
`if let` syntax, which can be useful in situations where the `match` expression
is a bit wordy.
